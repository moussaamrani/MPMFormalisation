\textsc{Mpm} seems to have originated from the Modelling and 
Simulation community. As early as 1996, the Esprit Basic 
Research Working Group \#8467 formulated a series of simulation policy 
guidelines \cite{Vangheluwe-VansteenkisteKerckhoffs-1996} proposing a request 
to build "a multi-paradigm methodology to express model knowledge using a blend 
of different abstract representations rather than inventing some new 
super-paradigm". In \cite{Vangheluwe-Vansteenkiste1996}, an \textsc{Mpm} and 
Simulation methodology is proposed, with a specific focus on formalisms and 
languages. Later on, \textsc{Mpm} became a well-recognised research field and a 
large body of research was produced and published in a dedicated MPM Workshop 
at the MoDELS conference. The \textsc{Cost} Action IC1404 on \textsc{Mpm4Cps} 
surveyed some existing languages and tools, and described through an ontology 
the languages and techniques for modelling \textsc{Cps} 
(\url{http://mpm4cps.eu}). This 
preliminary work triggered the effort presented in this paper. To the best of 
our through ontologies started during the \textsc{Cost} Action IC1404 \cite{}, 
knowledge, there has been no clear attempt to formally describe the notion of 
\textsc{Mpm}.
