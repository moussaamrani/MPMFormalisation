The notion of MPM appears to have originated from the modelling and simulation community and dates back as early as 1996 when the Esprit Basic Research Working Group 8467 formulated a series of simulation policy guidelines \cite{Vangheluwe-VansteenkisteKerckhoffs-1996}. In this work, a subject cluster is proposed requesting a "multi-paradigm methodology to express model knowledge using a blend of different abstract representations rather than inventing some new super-paradigm". In \cite{Vangheluwe-Vansteenkiste1996}, a multi-paradigm modelling and simulation methodology is proposed but with the focus on formalisms and languages. Later on, MPM became a well-recognised research field and a large body of research was produced and published in a dedicated MPM workshop at the MODELS conference and an attempt to formalise MPM with ontologies was recently made during the European COST action IC 1404 MPM4CPS. This work triggered this work on the notion of modelling paradigms, which was not addressed during MPM4CPS. Therefore, to our knowledge, among all the research on MPM, there is no attempt to formalise the notion of modelling paradigms.
