The notion of MPM appears to have originated from the modeling and simulation community and dates back as early as 1996, when the Esprit Basic Research Working Group 8467 formulated a series of simulation policy guidelines among which to improve the modelling and simulation process [TODO]. In this work, an action cluster is proposed on MPM.
