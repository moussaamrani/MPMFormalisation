\section{Running Example: CookieCAD}
\label{sec:Examples}

As a running, illustrative purpose, we take a very simplified variant of 
Computer-Aided Design (\textsc{Cad}) named CookieCAD (\textsc{CCad}), aimed at 
designed simple cookie cutters, as illustrated with a triangle shaped cookie in 
Figure \ref{fig:CookieCAD}(a). A cookie cutter has a certain shape (like 
triangles, rectangles, stars, etc.) represented by 2D geometric lines (noted 
$L$), which are specified based on the definition of points (noted $P$) placed 
on a cartesian plan (using real X- and Y-coordinates). Shapes must represent 
closed polygons, eventually by sharing some lines (for example, defining a 
house-shaped cookie by associating a triangle for the roof, placed over a 
rectangle). Consequently, lines shall not cross each others as illustrated in 
Fig. \ref{fig:CookieCAD}(c), which results in an \emph{invalid} cookie cutter.

%Many engineering disciplines (civil, mechanical, electrical, among others) 
%require an \emph{a priori} \emph{design}, i.e. a kind of specification, or plan, 
%of the final object, be it a bridge, a car's clutcher, or a complex electronic 
%card. From an \textsc{Mpm} viewpoint, designs play the role of \emph{models}: 
%they abstract from the real product while still possessing interesting 
%properties, making them cheaper to produce and easier to analyse. To support 
%designers, Computer-Aided Design (\textsc{Cad}) promotes the use of computers to 
%help create, modify, and analyse designs, but also optimise against known 
%constraints from a given domain. \textsc{Cad} has significantly improved many 
%engineering disciplines by improving the designs quality and increase the 
%designers' productivity, and even becoming standard development tools for 
%disciplines like electronics. \textsc{Cad} tools allow the \emph{visually} 
%design in 2D, 3D and even 4D (adding the time dimension), based on various 
%techniques such as Finite Element Methods, thus manipulating complex 
%Differential Equations. 

%For the purpose of this introductory work, we propose the Poor-Man \textsc{Cad} 
%(abbreviated as \textsc{PCad}), a (toy) (multi-)formalism that allows designing 
%2D geometric lines (noted $L$) representing arbitrary shapes, based on the 
%definition of points (noted $P$) placed on a cartesian plan (defined by integer 
%X- and Y-coordinates). When required, lines may be colored to emphasize 
%surfaces of a shape or parts of a design. Colors (noted as $C$) are encoding as 
%RGB integer triples for simplicity. The following Definition and Example 
%provides a formal specification and a visual representation of a possible 
%design.

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:CCAD}Cookie-CAD Shapes] A \CCad-shape (or design) $s\in \CCAD$ is a set of lines. 
A \emph{line} $l \in L$ is defined as a set of exactly two points.
A \emph{point} $p\in P$ is a pair of reals.
The function $\SMapping$ maps shapes $s\in \CCAD$ to the union of points 
the lines constituting the shapes are made of.
\begin{displaymath}
   \begin{small}
      \begin{array}{rcl rcl}
         \CCAD &\eqdef& \wp(L) \\
         L     &\eqdef& \{ \{p, p'\} \;|\; p, p' \in P, p\neq p' \} \\
         P     &\eqdef& \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}
      \end{array}
   \end{small}
\end{displaymath}

The semantics of a \CCad-shape is captured by the function 
$\SMapping$, that maps each shape to the points the lines constituting the 
shape is built upon. 
\begin{displaymath}
   \begin{small}
      \begin{array}{rcl}
         \SMapping & \colon & \!\!\!
            \begin{array}[t]{rcl}
               \CCAD &\to& \wp(\wp(\mathbb{R}^2)) \\
                   o &\mapsto& \lbrace \lbrace u,v\rbrace \;|\; \exists 
u,v\in \mathbb{R}.\; 
                    \forall x \leq u \leq x'. \\
& & v{=}m{*}u{+}\left(y{-}m{*}x\right), o{=}\lbrace \lbrace x, y \rbrace, \lbrace x', y' \rbrace \rbrace,
%%
            \end{array}\\
      \end{array}
   \end{small}
\end{displaymath}
\noindent 
where $m = \frac{y'-y}{x'-x}$ and w.l.o.g. $x' \geq x$.
\end{Definition}
As minimal activities on \textsc{CCad} designs, one shall evidently 
\emph{create} shapes, \emph{check} their validity, viable 
cookie stencils, and ultimately \emph{manufacture} the cutters from 
the designs.


% \subsection{Finite-State Automata}
% \label{sec:Examples-FSM}
% 
% Finite State Automata (\textsc{Fsa}), as originally defined by Moore 
% \cite{J:Moore:1956}, link states with transitions that carry a label. 
% \textsc{Fsa} describe discrete state-based computations. Many variations of 
% \textsc{Fsa} exist together with various semantics, among which the 
% ``word-accepting'' semantics is one of the most used \cite{}. 
% 
% The \UML State Machines \cite{TR:UML-2.5:2015} is the language used by many 
% tools for expressing, among other possibilities, the behaviour of a \UML 
% object. Beyond state-based computations, \UML State Machines add several new 
% concepts like hierarchical and orthogonal states, history, and the possibility 
% to interact with the environment through outputs.
% 
% \subsection{Java}
% \label{sec:Examples-Java}
% 
% Java \cite{B:Java:2019} is a modern object-oriented programming language that 
% has become widely used for a large variety of applications.
