The notion of a programming paradigm is used to classify programming languages
and their accompanying workflows based on their salient features. Similarly, the
notion of a \emph{modelling paradigm} can be used to characterise the plethora of
modelling approaches used to engineer complex Cyber-Physical Systems (\textsc{cps}). Modelling
paradigms encompass formalisms, abstractions, workflows and supporting
tool(chain)s. A precise definition of this modelling paradigm notion is lacking
however. Such a definition will increase insight, will allow for formal
reasoning about the consistency of modelling frameworks and may serve as the
basis for the construction of new modelling, simulation, verification,
synthesis, \ldots environments to support design of \textsc{cps}. We present a formal framework aimed at
capturing the notion of modelling paradigm, as a first step towards a
comprehensive formalisation of multi-paradigm modelling. Our formalisation is
illustrated by CookieCAD, a simple Computer-Aided Design paradigm used in the
development of cookie stencils.
