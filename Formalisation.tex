\section{Formalisation}
\label{sec:Formalisation}

Our formal framework defines a \emph{paradigm} as a \emph{label}/\emph{name} 
$\iota$ denoting a set of properties $\pi\in\Pi$. We define a 
\emph{paradigmatic structure} $\mathsf{PS}\in \PS$ as a candidate structure that 
\emph{qualifies}, or \emph{embodies}, or \emph{follows} the paradigm $\iota$ if 
$\mathsf{PS}$ satisfies $\pi$. $\mathsf{PS}$ describes a set of workflows that 
describe various activities that are seen to be desirable for realising 
$\iota$. 

Since every aspects of the paradigmatic structure need to be explicitly 
modelled, we first introduce the two classical notions to manipulate languages 
explicitly, namely metamodels and models on the one hand, and transformation 
specification and execution on the other. 

A \emph{metamodel} $\mathsf{MM} \in \mathcal{M}$ specifies the \emph{abstract 
syntax} of a language $\mathsf{L}$. $\mathsf{MM}$ is expressed in a specific 
language called meta-metamodel. 
A \emph{model} $\mathsf{M} \in \mathbb{M}$ is a particular instance of 
$\mathsf{L}$, also specified using a language that may be visual / 
diagrammatic, textual or hybrid (and normally different from the 
meta-metamodel). When $\mathsf{M}$ is a valid instance of 
$\mathsf{MM}$, $\mathsf{M}$ is said to \emph{conform to} $\mathsf{MM}$ and noted 
$\mathsf{M} \rhd \mathsf{MM}$. 

A \emph{transformation specification} $\mathsf{T}\in\mathbb{T}$ is a triple 
$\mathsf{T} = ((\mathsf{MM_s^{i}})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}, 
(\mathsf{MM_t^{j}})_{\mathsf{j}\in[1..m]}, \mathsf{spec})$, where  
$(\mathsf{MM_s^{i}})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}$ and
$(\mathsf{MM_t^{j}})_{\mathsf{j}\in [1..m]}$ are indexed sets of source and
target languages, respectively, and constitute the transformation's 
\emph{signature}; while $\mathsf{spec}$ is a well-formed 
transformation definition written in a transformation language. A 
\emph{transformation execution} $\mathsf{TE_{T}}\in\TE$ is a general 
computation performed on (a) language instance(s) that conform(s) to the 
source language(s) of the transformation $\mathsf{T}\in\mathbb{T}$.

As an example, the $\mathsf{javac}$ compiler is a transformation 
$\mathsf{T}_{compil} = (\mathsf{MM_{Java}}, \mathsf{MM_{BC}}, \mathsf{javac})$
that outputs byte code (BC) from any (valid, conforming) Java program 
$\mathsf{J}  \rhd \mathsf{MM_{Java}}$. Note that $\mathsf{javac}$ is itself 
specified as a Java program (i.e. $\mathsf{javac} \rhd \mathsf{MM_{Java}}$).

\subsection{Templates}
\label{sec:Templates}

Templates are plain metamodels and transformations, specified with the usual 
meta-metamodel(s) and transformation languages. A key difference however is 
that they are not complete, in the sense that they require a regular metamodel 
(or transformations) to be matched. Templates are used as placeholders for 
enforcing transformation signatures, expressing high-level properties for 
metamodels and transformations (specifications), or capturing the necessary 
steps in a transformation. 
\begin{wrapfigure}[14]{r}{0.1\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{InheritenceTemplate}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Simple Class-Property Template for capturing Inheritance.}
  \label{fig:InheritenceTemplate}
\end{wrapfigure}
Suppose we want to formally specify Property $\mbox{OO}_3$ for inheritance in 
Table \ref{tab:Properties}. Figure \ref{fig:InheritenceTemplate} presents a 
minimal template defining the basic placeholders: to even allow discussing 
about super- and sub-classes, one need at least distinguishing between 
$\mathsf{C}$lass and Objects, and defining a partial order ($\mathsf{super}$) 
between classes. The inheritance property then states that any object of a 
subclass has access to the state defined by its class, but also to the state 
defined by its superclass. Note that using a \textsc{Mof}-like meta-metamodel 
for expressing the template provides navigational notation for free: the 
property would start with something like $\mathsf{c1, c2 : Class}$ such that 
$\mathsf{c2} \in \mathsf{c1.super}$.

Using templates requires a powerful, customisable matching process. For 
metamodels, contributions on model typing \cite{J:Degueule-etAl:2017}, a 
posteriori typing \cite{J:deLara-Guerra:2017}, and metamodel morphisms 
\cite{Salay-Mylopoulos-Esterbrook:2008,Duran-Zschaler-Troya:2012} may be 
appropriate; for transformations, the rich literature on reuse 
\cite{J:Kusel-etAl:2015} provides some guidelines on how to realise that. Hence, 
matching Fig. \ref{fig:InheritenceTemplate}'s template into the Java 
metamodel \cite{B:Java:2019} would match $\mathsf{ClassDeclaration}$ to 
$\mathsf{C}$ and the $\mathsf{extends}$ clause to $\mathsf{super}$. 
We simply capture this important relationship the following: for a template 
metamodel $\mathsf{TMM}\in\mathcal{M}$ and a regular metamodel 
$\mathsf{MM}\in\mathcal{M}$, we note $\mathsf{TMM} \rightsquigarrow 
\mathsf{MM}$ when $\mathsf{TMM}$ is appropriately matched by $\mathsf{MM}$.

\subsection{Workflow}
\label{sec:Workflow}


Transformations typically support the realisation of activities that are 
essential to the engineering of languages, typically for parsing and/or pretty 
printing, defining their semantics (translationally or operationnaly), 
analysing relevant properties, debugging, and of course executing, simulating, 
animating, etc. \cite{J:Lucio-Amrani-etAl:2014}. These activities, and others 
essential for a paradigm, are typically captured through a workflow.

In our framework, workflows describe precisely the set of activities captured 
by a candidate paradigmatic structure. A workflow is composed of two elements: 
a \emph{Formalism Transformation Graph} (\textsc{Ftg}) describes explicitly the 
links between formalisms / languages, stating which possible transformations 
may be used; and a \emph{Process Model} describes how language instances are 
combined together towards achieving a particular activity. Combining both 
elements results in a \textsc{Ftg+Pm}, as already described in 
\cite{Mustafiz-etAl:2012,Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2013,TR:Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2012}.

Instead of directly manipulating (meta-)models and/or transformations, our 
framework relies on \emph{names} that allow to retrieve the corresponding 
artefacts from a repository (eventually centralised as a Modelverse). This 
linking is captured by the following definition.

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Naming}Naming]
   The \emph{naming functions} associate names to their actual item:
   \begin{displaymath}
      \begin{array}{rcl}
         model  &\colon& \mathsf{MName} \nrightarrow \mathbb{M}\\
         mmodel &\colon& \mathsf{MMName} \nrightarrow \mathcal{M}\\
         tmm    &\colon& \mathsf{TMMName} \nrightarrow \mathcal{M}\\
         trans  &\colon& \mathsf{TName} \nrightarrow \mathbb{T}\\
         tt     &\colon& \mathsf{TTName} \nrightarrow \mathbb{T}\\
      \end{array}
   \end{displaymath}
\end{Definition}
\noindent
All functions are partial, returning an undefined item (noted $\bot$) when the 
repository stores no item with the asked name. Template names for metamodels 
($\mathsf{TMMName}$) and transformations ($\mathsf{TTName}$) are in a separate 
namespace than those for regular ones. The repository is ultimately responsible 
to retrieve appropriate items: for example, querying the repo with the template 
of Fig. \ref{fig:InheritenceTemplate} would eventually allow the selection of 
the Java metamodel if inheritance is required.

To accomodate with templates, we introduce \emph{extended} \textsc{Ftg}s, 
defined as a (name-restricted) mapping of (template) transformations (names) 
into a signature.

\begin{Definition}{(Extended) Formalism Transformation Graph (x\textsc{Ftg})}
%%
An \emph{Extended Formalism Transformation Graph} $\mathsf{FTG} \in \FTG(TR, 
MM)$ is a function  $\mathsf{FTG} \colon TR \to \langle MM \rangle \times 
\langle MM \rangle \times \mathbb{B}$.
\end{Definition}
\noindent
We parameterise $\FTG$ with two sets of names $TR\subseteq (\mathsf{TName}\cup 
\mathsf{TTName})$ for regular / template transformations, and $MM\subseteq 
(\mathsf{MMName} \cup \mathsf{TMMName})$ for regular / template metamodels. 
Let $tr \mapsto (\langle mm_1, \ldots, mm_n \rangle, \langle mm'_1, \ldots, 
mm'_m \rangle, b)$ be such a mapping in $\FTG(TR, MM)$: when $b$ is
set to true, $tn$ refers to an \emph{automatic} transformation (and human 
guided otherwise); and $mm_i$s (resp. $mm'_j$s) names are the \emph{source} 
(resp. \emph{target}) of $tr$.
%
% we call the $tmm_i$s (resp. $tmm'_j$s) the 
% \emph{source} (resp. \emph{target}) of $t$ in $\mathsf{FTG}$. 
% Compared to the original definition of \textsc{Ftg} 
% \cite{Mustafiz-etAl:2012,TR:Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2012}, the source(s) and/or 
% target(s) of $t$ may be abstract formalisms instead of only languages: we 
% require in this case that $t$ does not map to any transformation specification 
% (i.e. $trans(t) = \bot$). This extension confer users the possibility of 
% defining ''template`` transformations that rely on the concepts and semantics 
% of the abstract formalism, enforcing reuse of transformations at the expense of 
% the capacity to actually match template transformations to actual 
% transformations, and abstract formalisms to languages. \moussa{Refer to MDE 
% research about trafo reuse and model morphisms/typing!}

  \caption{Simple \textsc{Ftg}: compilation and hierarchy extraction.}
  \label{fig:OO_FTG}
\end{wrapfigure}
Figure \ref{fig:OO_FTG} pictures a simple \textsc{Ftg} using two template, 
automatic transformations (names) (represented with double-rounded, white 
items) called $\mathsf{Compile}, \mathsf{ExtractH}\in 
\mathsf{TTransName}$ that respectively compile and extract the class hierarchy 
of a template metamodel $\mathsf{OO\_MM}\in\mathsf{TMMName}$. 

\medskip
As its name indicates, a \textsc{Pm} describes a process, i.e., a set of 
activities that are combined together towards achieving a particular goal. 
Instead of reinventing a Domain-Specific Language for this well-studied domain, 
we simply specialise one standard and well-known language that covers our 
needs, namely \textsc{Uml}'s Activity Diagrams.

\moussa{Currently, we don't use actors, as it is the case in UML AD with 
swimlanes, which provide some context about how actions (in our case, 
transformations) are performed: who, where, etc. I remember we briefly 
mentionned that during the Workshop...} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% PROCESS MODEL
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{Definition}[\label{def:PM}Process Model (\textsc{Pm})]
% %
A \emph{process model} $\mathsf{P}\in\PM$ is an instance of a \textsc{Uml}
Activity Diagram where
\begin{itemize}
   \item $\mathsf{ActionNode}$s are labelled by transformation instance names 
typed by their conforming transformation specifications, and may be 
\emph{hierarchical} and may contain input/output $\mathsf{Pin}$s; and 
   \item $\mathsf{ObjectNode}$s are labelled by language instance names typed 
by their conforming languages; and 
   \item $\mathsf{ControlNode}$s include 
$\mathsf{Decision}$/$\mathsf{Merge}$, $\mathsf{Fork}$/$\mathsf{Join}$ and 
$\mathsf{Init}$/$\mathsf{Final}$s nodes.   
\end{itemize}

  \caption{Simple compiling \textsc{PM}.}

Figure \ref{fig:OO_PM} pictures a compilation process between one 
$\mathsf{ObjectNode}$ representing a Java program $\mathsf{:Java}$ producing a 
ByteCode instance $\mathsf{:ByteCode}$ through the  $\mathsf{ActionNode}$ 
$\mathsf{javac}$.

\medskip
The following definition simply puts things together: a workflow is composed of 
an \textsc{Ftg} together with a \emph{well-formed} \textsc{Pm}. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% WORKFLOW
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Workflow}Workflow]
   A \emph{workflow} $\mathsf{W}\in\mathbb{W}(TR, MM)$ is a pair $\mathsf{W} = 
(\mathsf{FTG}, \mathsf{P})$ where $\mathsf{FTG}\in\FTG(TR, MM)$ and 
$\mathsf{P}\in\PM$, such that $\mathsf{P}$ is well-formed (noted 
$\mathsf{P} \blacktriangleright \mathsf{FTG}$) wrt. $\mathsf{FTG}$, i.e. for 
each $\mathsf{ActionNode}$ inside $\mathsf{P}$ with name 
$tr$,
\begin{itemize}
   \item there exists a transformation (name) $\mathsf{t}\in 
\Dom{\mathsf{FTG}}$ in the domain of $\mathsf{FTG}$, that refers to a 
transformation $tr$ conforms to, up to a matching morphism (i.e. 
$tr \rhd trans(\mathsf{t})$, or $tr \rhd \mathsf{MM}$ such that $\mathsf{MM} 
\rightsquigarrow tt(\mathsf{tr})$).
  
   \item for each source or target $fl_i$ of $t$ at rank $i$ with (template) 
metamodel $\mathsf{MM_i}$, there exists a $\mathsf{Pin}$ at rank $i$ connected 
(as input or output) to an $\mathsf{ObjectNode}$ carrying a model 
$model(\mathsf{mname}) \in \mathbb{M}$ conform to a metamodel $\mathsf{MM'}$ 
(i.e. $\mathsf{M} \rhd \mathsf{MM'}$) such that either $\mathsf{MM}$ is the 
$i$-metamodel of $tr$ (i.e. $\mathsf{MM} = \mathsf{MM'}$), or it matches it 
(i.e. $\mathsf{MM} \rightsquigarrow \mathsf{MM}$).

% typed by a language 
% $\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$, such that 
% $\mathsf{LI} \;\rhd\; \mathsf{L}$, and $\mathsf{L}\rightsquigarrow F$, then one 
% of the following holds:
%    \begin{itemize}
%       \item $fl_i\in \mathsf{AbstractFormalismN}$ then $fl_i$ denotes an 
% abstract formalism that should refine (some 
% of) the formalisms implemented by $\mathsf{L}$, i.e. $form(fl_i) \sqsubseteq 
% \mathsf{F'_{k_1}}, \ldots form(fl_i) \sqsubseteq \mathsf{F'_{k_n}}$ such that 
% $\mathsf{F'_{k_1}}, \ldots \mathsf{F'_{k_n}} \subseteq F$;
%       
%       \item $fl_i\in \mathsf{LanguageN}$ then $fl_i$ denotes a language. The 
% language that should refine $\mathsf{L}$ i.e. $lang(fl_i) \sqsubseteq 
% \mathsf{L}$.
%    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
\noindent
When clear from context, or unnecessarily detailed, we simply note the set of 
workflows $\mathbb{W}$, without any indication of languages or 
transformations (sets).

As illustration, the \textsc{Pm} in Fig. \ref{fig:OO_PM} is well-formed wrt. 
the \textsc{Ftg} in Fig. \ref{fig:OO_FTG}: as established earlier, 
$\mathsf{:\!Java}$ refers to a Java model, whose metamodel matches 
$\mathsf{OO\_MM}$ and $\mathsf{javac}$ is an appropriate match for 
$\mathsf{Compile}$; furthermore, no transformation (execution) are exhibited for 
matching $\mathsf{ExtractH}$.

Our definition for x\textsc{Ftg}s relies solely on \emph{names}: we heavily 
rely on the repository (Modelverse) capabilities in order to first retrieve the 
appropriate items (metamodels, models and transformations) as well as checking 
that matching between them is appropriately achieved. This was abstracted away 
in Def. \ref{def:Naming}, but requires a proper formalisation in the future.

Similar to the original  
\cite{Mustafiz-etAl:2012,Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2013,TR:Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2012},
our definition does not impose a particular topology on the $\mathsf{PM}$ as 
long as transformations are well-formed. However, the original definition 
simply rely on a name-matching typing, similar to what is depicted in Fig. 
\ref{fig:OO_PM}, leverage \UML{}-like Object/Class instanciation. In contrast, 
we introduced a relaxed matching mechanism based on metamodel/transformation 
matching relying on the $\rightsquigarrow$ relationship.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Paradigm}
\label{sec:PS}

Properties characterising a paradigm (as briefly described in Table 
\ref{tab:Properties}) may span over all the previous elements: for example, 
expressing the inheritance formally would require to have at disposal the 
(template) metamodel of Fig. \ref{fig:InheritenceTemplate}, but also access to 
its semantic domain to check that the state of a superclass becomes available 
to all objects of any subclass. Similarly, properties over transformations may 
restrict or constraint its applicability (e.g., $\mathsf{ExtractH}$ would have 
to define preconditions for object-oriented metamodels allowing multiple 
inheritance, and have a postcondition on the datastructure of its output). 
Properties may also characterise the topology, the usage and the matching 
process in an \textsc{Ftg} or its corresponding \textsc{Pm} (by, for example, 
ensuring frequent loops for the Agile paradigm). 

We first collect all previous elements in a single mathematical structure 
called \emph{paradigmatic structure} on which properties may hold.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% PARAD. STRUCTURE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{Definition}[Paradigmatic Structure]
   A \emph{paradigmatic structure} $\mathsf{PS}\in \PS$ is a pair $\mathsf{PS} 
= (MM, W)$ where $MM\in \wp(\mathcal{M})$ is a set of metamodels and 
$W \in \wp(\mathbb{W})$ is a set of workflows.
\end{Definition}

% Table \ref{tab:Properties} already described some interesting properties 
% related to three well-known paradigms. As easily noticeable, properties span 
% over all elements constituting a paradigmatic structure: the components of the 
% languages involved (and potentially, properties that require certain 
% combinations of languages); transformations; and also the processes. Some 
% paradigms may also have ''sanity-check`` properties that characterise the 
% paradigm itself. We will call these properties capturing the essence of a 
% paradigm \emph{paradigmatic properties}.

Following the mantra of modelling ''at the most appropriate 
level of abstraction``, it becomes impossible at the abstraction level of this 
presentation to formally (i.e., intensionally) define the nature of such a 
large class of properties. We therefore provide an extensional definition: we 
note $\mathcal{P}(S)$ the set of all possible properties expressible over a 
structure $S$. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
% PARAD. PROPERTIES 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:ParaProperties}Paradigmatic Properties]
   A \emph{paradigmatic property} is a tuple
$\pi = (\pi_{\mathsf{MM}},\pi_{\mathsf{W}},\pi_{\mathsf{PS}}) \in \Pi$ where
\begin{itemize}
   \item $\pi_{\mathsf{MM}} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{M})$ is a set of 
properties 
over metamodels (and their semantics);
   \item $\pi_{\mathsf{W}} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{W})$ is a set of properties 
over workflows (and their matching procedure);
   \item $\pi_{\mathsf{PS}}\in\mathcal{P}(\PS)$ is a set of 
properties spanning over all components of paradigmatic structures).
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
\noindent
Paradigmatic properties may be expressed through \emph{pattern languages}, 
e.g., 
for ensuring the presence of certain concepts, or through \emph{dedicated 
logics}, e.g., for ensuring semantic properties. 
% We detail later in the examples how some properties described in Table 
% \ref{tab:Properties} may be captured precisely.

We finally associate a \emph{name} to a set of properties for referring to a 
specific paradigm.
\begin{Definition}{\label{def:Paradigm}Paradigm}
Let $\mathsf{ParadigmName}$ be a set of (paradigm) names, that we associate to 
properties through a function $\iota \in [\mathsf{IntentN} \to \Pi]$.

For $\mathsf{paradigm}\in\mathsf{ParadigmName}$ such that 
$\iota(\mathsf{paradigm}) = (\pi_{\mathsf{MM}}(\mathsf{p}),                     
 \pi_{\mathsf{W}}(\mathsf{p}),                      
\pi_{\mathsf{PS}}(\mathsf{p}))$, 
we say that $\mathsf{PS} = (MM, W)\in\PS$ \emph{embodies} (alternatively, 
\emph{follows}, \emph{qualifies as}) $\mathsf{paradigm}$ iff
\begin{itemize}
   \item the properties $\pi_{\mathsf{MM}}(\mathsf{p})$ hold on $MM$;
   \item the properties $\pi_{\mathsf{W}}(\mathsf{p})$ hold on $W$; and
   \item the properties $ \pi_{\mathsf{PS}}(\mathsf{p}))$ hold on $\mathsf{PS}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
Notice that it may be interesting to introduce namespaces for paradigm names, 
since it is likely that similar denominations would be used for slightly 
different sets of properties: for example, one may define object orientation in 
the context of single or multiple inheritance, the latter requiring to take 
care of conflicting properties (as it is with the renaming mechanism in Eiffel).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Preliminaries}
% \label{sec:Formalisation-Preliminaries}
% 
% \begin{olddef}
% We assume in this paper that ``\emph{everything is modelled explicitly}`` by 
% using \emph{models} conformant to \emph{metamodels}, themselves explicitly 
% modelled (using a \emph{meta-metamodel}). The following definition introduces 
% precise notations for these notions.
% 
% \begin{Definition}[\label{def:MMM}(Meta-)Models \& Conformance]
%    Let $\mathbb{M}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ be the sets of all models and metamodels 
% respectively, as defined by meta-metamodels. For a model $\mathsf{M} \in 
% \mathbb{M}$ and a metamodel $\mathsf{MM} \in \mathcal{M}$, we write $\mathsf{M} 
% \rhd \mathsf{MM}$ if $\mathsf{M}$ \emph{conforms to} $\mathsf{MM}$.
% \end{Definition}
% This definition explicitly distinguishes between two meanings for what is 
% called an \emph{instance}, namely the difference between \emph{linguistic} and 
% \emph{ontological} instantiation \cite{J:Kuhne:2006}. \textsf{M} and \textsf{MM} 
% are \emph{valid} (linguistic) instances of their respective meta-metamodels in 
% the sense that they belong to the valid ''\emph{phrases}'' that the 
% meta-metamodel defines; whereas the fact that \textsf{M} is an 
% \emph{ontological} instance of \textsf{MM} needs to be checked, making 
% \textsf{M} conform to \emph{MM}. This checking procedure has been extensively 
% described by many previous contributions (see e.g. 
% \cite{PhD:Amrani:2013,J:Rivera-Duran-Vallecillo:2009}).
% \end{olddef}
% \begin{newdef}
% In this paper we follow the motto that ``\emph{everything is modelled explicitly}''. This means that, whenever we have a set of things we want to reason about (models, transformations, properties) we specify that set in some concrete fashion. The set is then called the \emph{extension} and its specification its \emph{intension}. A given object is said to \emph{conform} to a specification if it is an element of its extension. Checking conformance can be a non-trivial task in practice.
% 
% In many contexts, the intension is called a \emph{metamodel} and an element of its extension a \emph{model}. Metamodels themselves also form a set, and so according our own motto can be specified in a \emph{meta-metamodel}. 
% \end{newdef}
% 
% The choice of a specific meta-metamodel determines the technological space 
% chosen for metamodelling \cite{Wimmer-Kramler:2005}: \emph{grammarware} have a 
% tree-based structure and are fully textual; whereas \emph{modelsware} are either 
% visual or textual (or both), and rely either on \textsc{Mof}-like tree-based 
% (meta-)metamodels, or Graph Theory. 
% 
% 
% % Take as a simple example \emph{object orientation} as a fairly recognised 
% % intent, which may translate into the following list of properties: the 
% % existence of objects possessing an identity; a notion of class that types 
% % objects, and that defines data and functions of these objects; a relation on 
% % classes called inheritence that allows objects of one class to acquire 
% % properties of objects of another class; and the existence of a message passing 
% % mechanism between objects. 
% % \moussa{Maybe factor out this description in a previous section dedicated to 
% % provide the intuition about paradigms?}. 
% 
% \begin{olddef}
% In order to designate specific items of our formalisation explicitly by their 
% name, we define distinct namespaces as sorted sets. Properly resolving 
% namespaces is out of scope, as it relies on specific tooling 
% capabilities and implementation choices.
% 
% \begin{Definition}[Names]
%    The sorted set $\mathsf{Name}$ of \emph{names} defines namespaces over 
% \emph{items}.
%    \begin{small}
%    \begin{displaymath}
%      \begin{array}{rcl}
% 		\mathsf{Item} & \eqdef & \{\mathsf{AbstractFormalism}, \mathsf{Language}, 
% \mathsf{Transformation}\\
%                     &        & \mathsf{Intent}, \mathsf{LangInstance}, 
% \mathsf{TransInstance}\}\\
% 		\mathsf{Name}    & \eqdef & (\mathsf{Name}_{_{\mathsf{e}}})_{_{\mathsf{e} 
% \in \mathsf{Item}}}
%       \end{array}
% \end{displaymath}
%    \end{small}
% \end{Definition}
% To avoid the subscripted notation, we introduce a more compact notation for 
% referring to names: for example, the set of class names 
% $\mathsf{Name_{_{Language}}}$ will be noted $\mathsf{LanguageN}$.  
% \end{olddef}
% \begin{newdef}
% In order to be able to refer to elements of our formalisation, we introduce the concept of \emph{names}, which are \emph{identifiers} in a \emph{namespace}. Namespaces are themselves either also names, or can be the top (global) namespace. To formalise this, we assume a universe of \emph{identifiers} $\ID$, and a \emph{top namespace} $\top$; then the set of namespaces \NS and the set of names \Name are the smallest sets satisfying
% \[\begin{array}{rcl}
% \NS & \eqdef & \{\top\} \cup \Name \\
% \Name & \eqdef & \NS \times \ID
% \end{array}\]
% We immediately adopt the common dot-separated (concrete) syntax for names.
% For instance, \textsf{ANSI.C} denotes the name $((\top,\mathsf{ANSI}), \mathsf{C})$: it is the qualified name of the language with identifier \textsf{C} in the namespace \textsf{ANSI}, which is itself a name consisting of the identifier \textsf{ANSI} in the top namespace, $\top$. Another example of a namespace is this paper itself: the terminology used in this paper should be understood in that namespace --- we are well aware that the same identifiers (such as \textit{language}, \textit{formalism}, \textit{syntax}) can and do have different definitions elsewhere.
% \end{newdef}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Formalism \& Language}
% \label{sec:Formalism-Language}
% 
% \begin{olddef}
% We first introduce a distinction between \emph{formalisms} and \emph{languages}: 
% a \emph{formalism} is a mathematical construction built for capturing the 
% \emph{essence} and the \emph{core concepts} of a \emph{language}. 
% 
% \begin{Definition}[\label{def:Formalism}Formalism]
%    A \emph{formalism} $\mathsf{F}\in\mathbb{F}$ is a triple $\mathsf{F} = 
% (\mathsf{AS}, 
% \SMapping, \mathsf{SD})$, where $\mathsf{AS}\in\mathcal{M}$ is a metamodel

% \begin{Definition}[\label{def:Language}Language]
%    A \emph{language specification} (or \emph{language} 
% for short) $\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$ is a tuple $\mathsf{L} = (\mathsf{CS},

% Our definition for languages is \emph{extensional}: it only specifies the sets

% \cite{J:Harel-Rumpe:2004}), without providing a constructing approach to 
% manipulate them. However, effectively checking that a language instance 
% conforms to its specification requires an \emph{intentional}, explicit

% is also coined as a \emph{visual} / \emph{diagrammatic} vs. \emph{textual} 
% language.

% 
% \begin{newdef}
% We first introduce a distinction between \emph{formalisms} and \emph{languages}, following \cite{} in our choice of terminology. Note that the definitions concentrate on the \emph{extensions} of those concepts.
% 
% \begin{Definition}[\label{def:Language}(Concrete) language]
% A \emph{language} $L=\tuple{\AS}$ consists only of a set \AS, often called its \emph{abstract syntax}. 
% A \emph{concrete language} is a tuple $\CL=\tuple{\CS,\AS,\parse}$ where
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \CS is a set, called the \emph{concrete syntax};
% \item $$\tuple{\AS}$$ is a language;
% \item $\parse:\CS\rightarrow\AS$ is a partial function, called the \emph{parsing function}.
% \end{itemize}
% The universe of all languages is denoted $\Lu$, and the universe of concrete languages $\CLu$. We regard every concrete language to be a language, i.e., $\CLu\subset\Lu$.
% \end{Definition}
% %
% Parsing is partial because there may be concrete syntax elements that are not well-formed, and so cannot be parsed to an abstract syntax element. An example concrete syntax is the set of all well-formed electrical circuit diagrams; a corresponding abstract syntax is the set of all object diagrams representing the circuits.
% %
% % \begin{newdef}
% % Based on our example, we define the formalism $\PCAD = \left(L,
% % \SMapping, \wp(\mathbb{R}^2)\right)$, where $m$ is the metamodel depicted in 
% % Fig.~\ref{fig:PCAD-MM} and $\SMapping$ as specified in 
% % Def.~\ref{def:PCAD}. 
% % \end{newdef}
% 
% % \begin{newdef}
% % For the $\PCAD$, $\CS$ could be drawings consisting of straight 
% % lines or textual representations (e.g., TikZ\footnote{TikZ Website: \url{https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf}} 
% % for LaTeX) with a corresponding parsing function.
% % \end{newdef}
% 
% \begin{Definition}[\label{def:Formalism}(Concrete) formalism]
% A \emph{formalism} is a 3-tuple $F=\tuple{\AS,\SD,\sem\cdot}$ where
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \AS is a language;
% \item \SD is a set, called the \emph{semantic domain};
% \item $\sem\cdot:\AS\rightarrow\SD$ is a function, called the \emph{semantic mapping}.
% \end{itemize}
% A \emph{concrete formalism} is a 5-tuple $\CF=\tuple{\CS,\AS,\SD,\parse,\sem\cdot}$ such that
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\tuple{\CS,\AS,\parse}$ is a concrete language;
% \item $\tuple{\AS,\SD,\sem\cdot}$ is a formalism.
% \end{itemize}
% The universe of all formalisms is denoted $\Fu$, and the universe of concrete formalisms $\CFu$. We regard every concrete formalism to be a formalism, i.e., $\CFu\subset\Fu$. Moreover, every language is a formalism ($\Lu\subset \Fu$) and every concrete language a concrete formalism ($\CLu\subset \CFu$).
% \end{Definition}
% %
% As remarked above, these definitions are \emph{extensional}: they only specify the sets (very often infinite)
% involved in the structure of a language (as advocated e.g. by Harel \& Rumpe 
% \cite{J:Harel-Rumpe:2004}), without providing a constructive approach to 
% manipulate them. In practice, the concrete and abstract syntax are always specified \emph{intensionally}, meaning that they arise as the semantics of another (meta-)formalism. Depending on that other formalism, a given language or formalism may be called \emph{visual} / \emph{diagrammatic} (if the meta-formalism is similar to UML metamodels) or \emph{textual} (if the meta-formalism is a textual grammar).
% \end{newdef}
% \begin{olddef}
% According to Broman \emph{et al.} \cite{Broman-etAl:2012}, a language 
% (alternatively called \emph{concrete formalism} in \cite{P:MPM:2006}) is ``a 
% concrete implementation of formalism(s)``: 
% for practical reasons, a language may rely on several 
% formalisms, and may introduce semantics variations wrt. the formalism's 
% semantics it implements. We formally capture the \emph{implementation} 
% relationship between languages and formalisms.
% \begin{Definition}[\label{def:Implementation}Implementation/Refinement]
%    
%    We write $\mathsf{L} \rightsquigarrow \mathsf{F_1}, \ldots, \mathsf{F_n}$ 
% when the language $\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$ \emph{implements} the formalisms 
% $\mathsf{F_1}, \ldots, \mathsf{F_n}\in\mathbb{F}$. We say that $\mathsf{L}$ 
% refines $\mathsf{L'}$, noted $\mathsf{L} \sqsubseteq \mathsf{L'}$ if for all 
% formalisms $\mathsf{F'_i}$ implemented by $\mathsf{L'}$, there exists some 
% formalisms $\mathsf{F_1}, \ldots, \mathsf{F_n}$ that refine $\mathsf{F'_i}$ 
% (i.e. $\mathsf{F_k} \sqsubseteq \mathsf{F'_i}$ for $k\in [1..n]$).
% \end{Definition}
% \noindent
% Software language designers use intricate combinations of formalism(s) to reach 
% the current requirements for language usability, efficiency, readability, etc., 
% blurring this relations along the way. 
% Therefore, automatically checking the implementation relation is difficult, and 
% requires anyway a mathematical machinery way beyond the scope of this paper: 
% the implementation relation requires pattern matching over the abstract 
% syntaxes of formalisms and languages, but also powerful refinement and 
% trace simulation operators to ensure semantic preservation. 
% However, since the formalisms implemented by a language are transparent for the 
% end-users, we focus our formalisation on languages rather than the formalisms: 
% the implementation relation allows to retrieve them if needed.
% 
% \begin{Example}[\label{ex:PCADC}(Colored) \textsc{PCad} Formalism and 
% Language]
%       We define $\mathsf{PCAD, PCADC} \in 
% \mathsf{Name}_{_{\mathsf{Language}}}$. Definition \ref{def:PCAD} defines the 
% (colored) Poor-Man \textsc{Cad} formalism mathematically: the abstract syntax 
% \textsf{AS}$_{_{\mathsf{PCAD}}}$ is captured by the defining set $\CCAD$ (resp. 
% \textsf{AS}$_{_{\mathsf{PCADC}}} \eqdef \PCADC$); the semantic domain 
% \textsf{SD}$_{_{\mathsf{PCAD}}}$ identifies to $L$ (resp. 
% \textsf{SD}$_{_{\mathsf{PCADC}}} \eqdef \PCADC$); and the semantic mapping is 
% captured by the (overloaded) function(s) $\SMapping$ in Def. \ref{def:CCAD}. A

However, in practice, a metamodeller uses a specific language framework that implements such technological spaces and provides facilities for manipulating (meta-)models. As a result, when creating a language $\mathsf{L}$, the concrete and abstract syntaxes (\CS and \AS) can be
% expressed as (linguistic) instances of the technological spaces' languages. 
% This allows us to define a \emph{canonical abstract syntax} for any language: the set of all valid (linguistic) sentences allowed by (i.e., conforming to) a given metamodel.

% semantics of the language $\mathsf{AS}\in\mathcal{M}$ is an instance of.
% \end{Definition}
% Being regular formalisms (according to Def. \ref{def:Formalism}), the

% 
% It is always possible to extract an abstract formalism  
% $\mathsf{F^\star}\in\mathbb{F}$ from a language $\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$ by

% \subsection{Transformations}
% \label{sec:Formalisation-Transformation}
% 
% Transformations are the primary tool for capturing manipulations of language 
% elements as part of a workflow. They may be arbitrarily complex, and come in 
% different variations depending on their features \cite{J:Mens-VonGorp:2006} and 
% properties and intents \cite{J:Lucio-Amrani-etAl:2014}. What is relevant in 
% this work is the transformation's \emph{signature}, i.e. which source / target 
% languages the transformation operates on, rather than how it is specified. As 
% usual however, we distinguish between the transformation \emph{specification} 
% and its actual \emph{execution}(s).
% 
% \begin{olddef}
% \begin{Definition}[Transformation\label{def:Transformation}]
%    A \emph{transformation specification} $\mathsf{T}\in\mathbb{T}$ is a pair
% $\mathsf{T} = ((\mathsf{L_s^{i}})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}, 
% (\mathsf{L_t^{j}})_{\mathsf{j}\in[1..m]})$ where  
% $(\mathsf{L_s^{i}})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}$ and
% $(\mathsf{L_t^{j}})_{\mathsf{j}\in [1..m]}$ are indexed sets of source and

% transformation definition written in a transformation language.
%

% Pursuing on our \textsc{Fsa} example, the \textsc{Uml} State Machines language
% \cite{} offers one concrete syntax to the \textsc{Fsa} formalism (by defining 
% how to represent initial, final and ''normal`` states), but also adds several 
% new concepts like hierarchical / orthogonal states, and reactions over 
% transitions (for facilitating design and integration with other \textsc{Uml} 
% languages, among other reasons) that impose to change the \textsc{Fsa} 
% semantics to take them into account.


% This leads to the usual distinction between 
% \emph{linguisting} and \emph{ontological} instantiation \cite{J:Kuhne:2006}: the 
% linguistic instantiation checks that an element $\mathsf{cs}$ is well-formed 
% regarding the concrete syntax $\mathsf{CS}$; while the ontological 
% instantiation checks the validity of $\mathsf{cs}$ regarding the concrete 
% definition of the abstract syntax $\mathsf{AS}$.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Workflow}
% \label{sec:Workflow}
% 
% Workflows constitute the essence of a paradigm: they describe precisely how 
% formalisms (or more precisely, languages) are related to each other through 
% transformations, in order to achieve an expected intent. 
% A workflow is composed of two elements: a \emph{Formalism Transformation Graph} 
% (\textsc{Ftg}) describes explicitly the links between formalisms / languages, 
% stating what possible transformations may be used; and a \emph{Process Model} 
% (\textsc{Pm}) describes how language instances are 
% combined together to achieve the intent $\iota$. Combining both elements 
% results in the \textsc{Ftg+Pm} formalism and language that has already been 
% described in 
% \cite{Mustafiz-etAl:2012,Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2013,TR:Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2012}.
% 
% Before providing a definition of \textsc{Ftg+Pm}, we need to introduce a naming 
% mechanism: instead of directly manipulating languages and transformations, a 
% repository links the names used by an \textsc{Ftg+Pm} to their actual items. 
% This linking is formally captured by the following definition:
% 
% 
% \moussa{All FTG+PM I ever seen, either published by the original authors, or 
% contributed by the COST participants, rely on \emph{languages}, not 
% \emph{formalism} (as per the definitions provided in this paper). In a way, it 
% makes sense: since formalisms are ''mathematical`` object, they have no 
% concrete existence (although, as always, we often associate to a formalism a 
% ''visual`` syntax to facilitate understanding: this is what all mathematicians 
% do to convey their ideas!) beyond, say LaTeX formulaes and pictures. So IMHO, 
% FTG is a misleading name!!! Once the link between language and formalism is 
% establish, it ultimately does not change much in the definitions: IMO, it even 
% makes them more natural and understable than those falsely relying on 
% formalisms. FEEL FREE TO ARGUMENT OTHERWISE!}
% 
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% % NAMING
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{Definition}[\label{def:Naming}Naming]
%    Two \emph{naming functions} associate (sorted) names to their actual item:
%    \begin{displaymath}
%       \begin{array}{rcl}
%          form  &\colon& \mathsf{AbstractFormalismN} \to \mathbb{F}\\
%          trans &\colon& \mathsf{TransformationN} \nrightarrow \mathbb{T}\\
%          lang  &\colon& \mathsf{LanguageN} \to \mathbb{L}
%       \end{array}
%    \end{displaymath}
% \end{Definition}

% An \textsc{Ftg} can be seen as a collection of transformations that are 
% considered useful for a given context. Since transformation names are actually used, we use a functional definition.
% 
% \andreas{Shouldn't it be $\FTG(AFL,T)$ (in the following?), also I'm not sure

% \begin{Definition}{(Extended) Formalism Transformation Graph (x\textsc{Ftg})}
% %%
% Let $\mathsf{AFL} \eqdef \mathsf{AbstractFormalismN} \cup 
% \mathsf{LanguageN}$ be the union of (abstract) formalisms and languages names. A 
% \emph{Formalism Transformation Graph} $\mathsf{FTG} \in \FTG(FL, T)$ is a 
% function  $\mathsf{FTG} \colon T \to \langle FL \rangle \times \langle FL 
% \rangle \times \mathbb{B}$ restricted to specific subsets of language names $FL 
% \subseteq \mathsf{AFL}$ and transformation names $T\subseteq 
% \mathsf{TransformationN}$, and the boolean value indicates whether the 
% transformation is automatic or not (meaning that it becomes a human activity).
% %
% \end{Definition}
% 
% \noindent
% For $t \mapsto (\langle fl_1, \ldots, fl_n \rangle, \langle fl'_1, \ldots, 
% fl'_m \rangle, b)\in \mathsf{FTG}$, we call the $fl_i$s (resp. $fl'_j$s) the 
% \emph{source} (resp. \emph{target}) of $t$ in $\mathsf{FTG}$. 
% Compared to the original definition of \textsc{Ftg} 
% \cite{Mustafiz-etAl:2012,TR:Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2012}, the source(s) and/or 
% target(s) of $t$ may be abstract formalisms instead of only languages: we 
% require in this case that $t$ does not map to any transformation specification 
% (i.e. $trans(t) = \bot$). This extension confer users the possibility of 
% defining ''template`` transformations that rely on the concepts and semantics 
% of the abstract formalism, enforcing reuse of transformations at the expense of 
% the capacity to actually match template transformations to actual 
% transformations, and abstract formalisms to languages. \moussa{Refer to MDE 
% research about trafo reuse and model morphisms/typing!}

% In practice, we represent \textsf{FTG} with colored rounds for transformations 
% (names) to distinguish between automatic and manual ones, and shared rectangles 
% for languages (names).

% \medskip
% As its name indicates, a \textsc{Pm} describes a process, i.e., a set of 
% activities that are combined together towards achieving a particular goal. 
% Instead of reinventing a Domain-Specific Language for this well-studied domain, 
% we simply specialise one standard and well-known language that covers our 
% needs, namely \textsc{Uml}'s Activity Diagrams.
% 
% \moussa{Currently, we don't use actors, as it is the case in UML AD with

% From our viewpoint, a paradigm is a set of properties that captures

% $W \in \wp(\mathbb{W})$ is a set of workflows.
% \end{Definition}
% 
% Table \ref{tab:Properties} already described some interesting properties

% combinations of languages); transformations; and also the processes. Some 
% paradigms may also have ''sanity-check`` properties that characterise the 
% paradigm itself. We will call these properties capturing the essence of a

% 
% Following the mantra of modelling ''at the most appropriate 
% level of abstraction``, it becomes impossible at the abstraction level of this

%    A \emph{paradigmatic property} is a tuple
% $\pi = (\pi_{\mathsf{L}},\pi_{\mathsf{W}},\pi_{\mathsf{PS}}) \in \Pi$ where
% \begin{itemize}
%    \item $\pi_{\mathsf{L}} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{L})$ is a set of properties 
% over languages;
%    \item $\pi_{\mathsf{W}} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{W})$ is a set of properties 
% over workflows;
%    \item $\pi_{\mathsf{PS}}\in\mathcal{P}(\PS)$ is a set of 
% properties spanning over all components of paradigmatic structures).
% \end{itemize}
% \end{Definition}
% \noindent
% Paradigmatic properties may be expressed through \emph{pattern languages}, e.g., 
% for ensuring the presence of certain concepts, or through \emph{dedicated 
% logics}, e.g., for ensuring semantic properties. We detail later in the examples 
% how some properties described in Table \ref{tab:Properties} may be captured 
% precisely.
% 
% For instance, relevant paradigmatic properties for a paradigmatic structures $PS
% = \left(L,W\right)$ representing Simple Computer Aided Design in the sense of
% Table~\ref{tab:Properties}, $\Pi_{SCAD}$, could be
% \begin{itemize}
% %%
% \item $\pi_{\mathsf{SCAD1}} \equiv$ $L$ features a class $P$ that has two 
% attributes $a$ and $b$ that each support values of $\mathbb{R}$ and a class $L$ 
% that has two instances of $P$. 
% %%
% \item $\pi_{\mathsf{SCAD2}} \equiv$ $L$ features a class $D$ that captures a 
% collection of $L$ instances; 
%  
% \item $\pi_{\mathsf{SCAD3}} \equiv$ $W$ supports translating $D$ instances into products;
% % \item $\pi_{\mathsf{W_2}}...$ there is a workflow that supports checking
% % closedness of shapes.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \label{fig:LanguageProperties} illustrates $\pi_{\mathsf{CAD1}}$ and
% $\pi_{\mathsf{CAD2}}$ as patterns over the abstract syntax of $L$. These
% patterns could be modeled and matched leveraging the notion of model
% types~\cite{steel2007model}, which ultimately checks conformance as graph
% isomorphism between the two metamodels (out of which one would be the pattern).
% The representation of $\pi_{\mathsf{CAD3}}$ depends on the representation of the
% xFTG. Generally, this entails that the xFTG of $W$ of the $PS$ must comprise a
% sequence of formalisms and transformations that begins with the formalism $D$
% matched for representing drawings and ends with a formalism representing
% products.
