\section{Formalisation}
\label{sec:Formalisation}
\moussa{Rewrite this descripton}

Our formalisation defines a \emph{paradigm} as a set of 
\emph{characterising properties} $\mathsf{\Pi}$ that holds over a mathematical 
construction called a \emph{paradigmatic structure} $\mathsf{PS}\in \PS$. 
This structure describes a specific \emph{workflow} (or \emph{process}) that 
captures how specific \emph{languages instances} are combined together, 
through transformations, towards achieving a specific intent $\iota$ that is 
adequately characterised by the properties. When $\iota$ has a commonly agreed 
name (in a given context, or for a specific community), and $\mathsf{\Pi}$ holds 
on a specific $\mathsf{PS}$, then $\mathsf{PS}$ is said to \emph{qualify} as 
the paradigm $\iota$. The properties constituting $\mathsf{\Pi}$ may 
characterise the formalisms and/or the workflow defining a paradigmatic 
structure.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:Formalisation-Preliminaries}

\begin{olddef}
We assume in this paper that ``\emph{everything is modelled explicitly}`` by 
using \emph{models} conformant to \emph{metamodels}, themselves explicitly 
modelled (using a \emph{meta-metamodel}). The following definition introduces 
precise notations for these notions.

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:MMM}(Meta-)Models \& Conformance]
   Let $\mathbb{M}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ be the sets of all models and metamodels 
respectively, as defined by meta-metamodels. For a model $\mathsf{M} \in 
\mathbb{M}$ and a metamodel $\mathsf{MM} \in \mathcal{M}$, we write $\mathsf{M} 
\rhd \mathsf{MM}$ if $\mathsf{M}$ \emph{conforms to} $\mathsf{MM}$.
\end{Definition}
This definition explicitly distinguishes between two meanings for what is 
called an \emph{instance}, namely the difference between \emph{linguistic} and 
\emph{ontological} instantiation \cite{J:Kuhne:2006}. \textsf{M} and \textsf{MM} 
are \emph{valid} (linguistic) instances of their respective meta-metamodels in 
the sense that they belong to the valid ''\emph{phrases}'' that the 
meta-metamodel defines; whereas the fact that \textsf{M} is an 
\emph{ontological} instance of \textsf{MM} needs to be checked, making 
\textsf{M} conform to \emph{MM}. This checking procedure has been extensively 
described by many previous contributions (see e.g. 
\cite{PhD:Amrani:2013,J:Rivera-Duran-Vallecillo:2009}).
\end{olddef}
\begin{newdef}
In this paper we follow the motto that ``\emph{everything is modelled explicitly}''. This means that, whenever we have a set of things we want to reason about (models, transformations, properties) we specify that set in some concrete fashion. The set is then called the \emph{extension} and its specification its \emph{intension}. A given object is said to \emph{conform} to a specification if it is an element of its extension. Checking conformance can be a non-trivial task in practice.

In many contexts, the intension is called a \emph{metamodel} and an element of its extension a \emph{model}. Metamodels themselves also form a set, and so according our own motto can be specified in a \emph{meta-metamodel}. 
\end{newdef}

The choice of a specific meta-metamodel determines the technological space 
chosen for metamodelling \cite{Wimmer-Kramler:2005}: \emph{grammarware} have a 
tree-based structure and are fully textual; whereas \emph{modelsware} are either 
visual or textual (or both), and rely either on \textsc{Mof}-like tree-based 
(meta-)metamodels, or Graph Theory. 


% Take as a simple example \emph{object orientation} as a fairly recognised 
% intent, which may translate into the following list of properties: the 
% existence of objects possessing an identity; a notion of class that types 
% objects, and that defines data and functions of these objects; a relation on 
% classes called inheritence that allows objects of one class to acquire 
% properties of objects of another class; and the existence of a message passing 
% mechanism between objects. 
% \moussa{Maybe factor out this description in a previous section dedicated to 
% provide the intuition about paradigms?}. 

\begin{olddef}
In order to designate specific items of our formalisation explicitly by their 
name, we define distinct namespaces as sorted sets. Properly resolving 
namespaces is out of scope, as it relies on specific tooling 
capabilities and implementation choices.

\begin{Definition}[Names]
   The sorted set $\mathsf{Name}$ of \emph{names} defines namespaces over 
\emph{items}.
   \begin{small}
   \begin{displaymath}
     \begin{array}{rcl}
		\mathsf{Item} & \eqdef & \{\mathsf{AbstractFormalism}, \mathsf{Language}, 
\mathsf{Transformation}\\
                    &        & \mathsf{Intent}, \mathsf{LangInstance}, 
\mathsf{TransInstance}\}\\
		\mathsf{Name}    & \eqdef & (\mathsf{Name}_{_{\mathsf{e}}})_{_{\mathsf{e} 
\in \mathsf{Item}}}
      \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
   \end{small}
\end{Definition}
To avoid the subscripted notation, we introduce a more compact notation for 
referring to names: for example, the set of class names 
$\mathsf{Name_{_{Language}}}$ will be noted $\mathsf{LanguageN}$.  
\end{olddef}
\begin{newdef}
In order to be able to refer to elements of our formalisation, we introduce the concept of \emph{names}, which are \emph{identifiers} in a \emph{namespace}. Namespaces are themselves either also names, or can be the top (global) namespace. To formalise this, we assume a universe of \emph{identifiers} $\ID$, and a \emph{top namespace} $\top$; then the set of namespaces \NS and the set of names \Name are the smallest sets satisfying
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\NS & \eqdef & \{\top\} \cup \Name \\
\Name & \eqdef & \NS \times \ID
\end{array}\]
For instance, \textsf{ANSI.C} is the qualified name of the language with identifier \textsf{C} in the namespace \textsf{ANSI}, which is itself a name consisting of the identifier \textsf{ANSI} in the top namespace, $\top$. Another occurrence of namespaces is this paper itself: the terminology used in this paper should be understood in that namespace --- we are well aware that the same identifiers (such as \textit{language}, \textit{formalism}, \textit{syntax}) can and do have different definitions elsewhere.
\end{newdef}

\subsection{Formalism \& Language}
\label{sec:Formalism-Language}

\begin{olddef}
We first introduce a distinction between \emph{formalisms} and \emph{languages}: 
a \emph{formalism} is a mathematical construction built for capturing the 
\emph{essence} and the \emph{core concepts} of a \emph{language}. 

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Formalism}Formalism]
   A \emph{formalism} $\mathsf{F}\in\mathbb{F}$ is a triple $\mathsf{F} = 
(\mathsf{AS}, 
\SMapping, \mathsf{SD})$, where $\mathsf{AS}\in\mathcal{M}$ is a metamodel 
defining an \emph{abstract syntax}; $\mathsf{SD}\in\mathbb{D}$ is a 
\emph{semantic domain}; and $\SMapping 
\colon \mathsf{AS} \to \mathsf{SD}$ is a \emph{semantic mapping} that uniquely 
associates to each valid abstract syntax instance a meaning (or interpretation) 
in terms of the semantic domain.
   
   We say that $\mathsf{F}$ \emph{refines} $\mathsf{F'}$, noted $\mathsf{F}
\sqsubseteq \mathsf{F'}$ when all concepts defined by
$\mathsf{AS}_{\mathsf{F}}$ are present in $\mathsf{AS}_{\mathsf{F'}}$ while
preserving its semantics.
\end{Definition}
Translating the core concepts captured by a formalism into a usable software 
language requires the definition of a \emph{concrete semantics} for 
users/modellers to manipulate language instances.

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Language}Language]
   A \emph{language specification} (or \emph{language} 
for short) $\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$ is a tuple $\mathsf{L} = (\mathsf{CS}, 
\mathsf{AS}, \SMapping, \mathsf{SD})$ where $\mathsf{CS}\in\mathcal{M}$ is a 
\emph{concrete syntax} for representing elements of the language;  
$\mathsf{AS}\in\mathcal{M}$ is an \emph{abstract syntax}; 
$\mathsf{SD}\in\mathbb{D}$ is 
a \emph{semantic domain}; and $\SMapping \colon \mathsf{AS} \to \mathsf{SD}$ is 
a \emph{semantic mapping}. 

   A \emph{language instance} $\mathsf{LI}\in\mathbb{M}$ of a language
$\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$ is a model conform to $\mathsf{AS}$ (i.e.
$\mathsf{LI} \rhd \mathsf{AS}$) and defined using \textsf{CS}.
\end{Definition}

\smallskip\noindent
Our definition for languages is \emph{extensional}: it only specifies the sets 
involved in the structure of a language (as advocated e.g. by Harel \& Rumpe 
\cite{J:Harel-Rumpe:2004}), without providing a constructing approach to 
manipulate them. However, effectively checking that a language instance 
conforms to its specification requires an \emph{intentional}, explicit 
definition of both syntaxes, abstract and concrete: explicitly defining an 
instance $\mathsf{LI}$ requires a language defining $\mathsf{CS}$, and checking 
the conformance requires a language defining $\mathsf{AS}$, making 
$\mathsf{AS}$ and $\mathsf{CS}$ \emph{linguistic} instances of their respective 
\emph{languages}. Depending on the $\mathsf{CS}$'s \emph{style}, $\mathsf{L}$ 
is also coined as a \emph{visual} / \emph{diagrammatic} vs. \emph{textual} 
language.
\end{olddef}

\begin{newdef}

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Language}(Concrete) language]
A \emph{language} is a set \AS, often called its \emph{abstract syntax}. 
A \emph{concrete language} is a tuple $\CL=\tuple{\CS,\AS,\parse}$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item \CS is a set, called the \emph{concrete syntax};
\item \AS is a language;
\item $\parse:\CS\rightarrow\AS$ is a partial function, called the \emph{parsing function}.
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
%
Parsing is partial because there may be concrete syntax elements that are not well-formed, and so cannot be parsed to an abstract syntax element.
%
% \begin{newdef}
% Based on our example, we define the formalism $\PCAD = \left(L,
% \SMapping, \wp(\mathbb{R}^2)\right)$, where $m$ is the metamodel depicted in 
% Fig.~\ref{fig:PCAD-MM} and $\SMapping$ as specified in 
% Def.~\ref{def:PCAD}. 
% \end{newdef}

% \begin{newdef}
% For the $\PCAD$, $\CS$ could be drawings consisting of straight 
% lines or textual representations (e.g., TikZ\footnote{TikZ Website: \url{https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf}} 
% for LaTeX) with a corresponding parsing function.
% \end{newdef}

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Formalism}(Concrete) formalism]
A \emph{formalism} is a 3-tuple $\CF=\tuple{\AS,\SD,\sem\cdot}$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item \AS is a language;
\item \SD is a set, called the \emph{semantic domain};
\item $\sem\cdot:\AS\rightarrow\SD$ is a function, called the \emph{semantic mapping}.
\end{itemize}
A \emph{concrete formalism} is a 5-tuple $\CF=\tuple{\CS,\AS,\SD,\parse,\sem\cdot}$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tuple{\CS,\AS,\parse}$ is a concrete language;
\item $\tuple{\AS,\SD,\sem\cdot}$ is a formalism.
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}


%
As remarked about, these definitions are \emph{extensional}: they only specify the sets
involved in the structure of a language (as advocated e.g. by Harel \& Rumpe 
\cite{J:Harel-Rumpe:2004}), without providing a constructive approach to 
manipulate them. In practice, the concrete and abstract syntax are always specified \emph{intensionally}, meaning that they arise as the semantics of another (meta-)formalism. Depending on that other formalism, a given language or formalism may be called \emph{visual} / \emph{diagrammatic} (if the meta-formalism is similar to UML metamodels) or \emph{textual} (if the meta-formalism is a textual grammar).
\end{newdef}
\begin{olddef}
According to Broman \emph{et al.} \cite{Broman-etAl:2012}, a language 
(alternatively called \emph{concrete formalism} in \cite{P:MPM:2006}) is ``a 
concrete implementation of formalism(s)``: 
for practical reasons, a language may rely on several 
formalisms, and may introduce semantics variations wrt. the formalism's 
semantics it implements. We formally capture the \emph{implementation} 
relationship between languages and formalisms.
\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Implementation}Implementation/Refinement]
   
   We write $\mathsf{L} \rightsquigarrow \mathsf{F_1}, \ldots, \mathsf{F_n}$ 
when the language $\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$ \emph{implements} the formalisms 
$\mathsf{F_1}, \ldots, \mathsf{F_n}\in\mathbb{F}$. We say that $\mathsf{L}$ 
refines $\mathsf{L'}$, noted $\mathsf{L} \sqsubseteq \mathsf{L'}$ if for all 
formalisms $\mathsf{F'_i}$ implemented by $\mathsf{L'}$, there exists some 
formalisms $\mathsf{F_1}, \ldots, \mathsf{F_n}$ that refine $\mathsf{F'_i}$ 
(i.e. $\mathsf{F_k} \sqsubseteq \mathsf{F'_i}$ for $k\in [1..n]$).
\end{Definition}
\end{olddef}
\noindent
Software language designers use intricate combinations of formalism(s) to reach 
the current requirements for language usability, efficiency, readability, etc., 
blurring this relations along the way. 
Therefore, automatically checking the implementation relation is difficult, and 
requires anyway a mathematical machinerie way beyond the scope of this paper: 
the implementation relation requires pattern matching over the abstract 
syntaxes of formalisms and languages, but also powerful refinement and 
trace simulation operators to ensure semantic preservation. 
However, since the formalisms implemented by a language are transparent for the 
end-users, we focus our formalisation on languages rather than the formalisms: 
the implementation relation allows to retrieve them if needed.

\begin{olddef}
\begin{Example}[\label{ex:PCADC}(Colored) \textsc{PCad} Formalism and 
Language]
      We define $\mathsf{PCAD, PCADC} \in 
\mathsf{Name}_{_{\mathsf{Language}}}$. Definition \ref{def:PCAD} defines the 
(colored) Poor-Man \textsc{Cad} formalism mathematically: the abstract syntax 
\textsf{AS}$_{_{\mathsf{PCAD}}}$ is captured by the defining set $\CCAD$ (resp. 
\textsf{AS}$_{_{\mathsf{PCADC}}} \eqdef \PCADC$); the semantic domain 
\textsf{SD}$_{_{\mathsf{PCAD}}}$ identifies to $L$ (resp. 
\textsf{SD}$_{_{\mathsf{PCADC}}} \eqdef \PCADC$); and the semantic mapping is 
captured by the (overloaded) function(s) $\SMapping$ in Def. \ref{def:CCAD}. A 
language for (colored) \textsc{PCad} may use the metamodel(s) of Figure 
\ref{fig:PCAD-MM}: in yellow for \textsc{PCad} and yellow/purple for colored 
\textsc{PCad}. Figure \ref{fig:PCAD-Visual} defines an instance 
$\mathsf{Form}\in\mathsf{Name}_{_{\mathsf{LangInstance}}}$ in a visual concrete 
syntax. We can easily manually check that $\mathsf{Form}\rhd \mathsf{PCADC}$.

\begin{figure}[t]

   \caption{A metamodel for \textsc{PCad} (cf. Definition 
\ref{def:CCAD}).}%

\end{figure}
\end{Example}
\end{olddef}

\begin{newdef}
\begin{Example}[\label{ex:CCAD}\textsc{CCad} Formalism and 
Language]
      We define $\mathsf{CCAD} \in 
\mathsf{Name}_{_{\mathsf{Language}}}$. Definition \ref{def:CCAD} defines the 
CookieCAD formalism mathematically: 
the abstract syntax \textsf{AS}$_{_{\mathsf{CCAD}}}$ is captured by the 
defining set $\CCAD$; 
the semantic domain \textsf{SD}$_{_{\mathsf{CCAD}}}$ identifies to $L$; 
and the semantic mapping is captured by the function $\SMapping$ in 
Def.~\ref{def:CCAD}. 
A language for \textsc{PCad} may use the metamodel of Fig.~\ref{fig:PCAD-MM}. 
% Figure \ref{fig:PCAD-Visual} defines an instance 
% $\mathsf{Form}\in\mathsf{Name}_{_{\mathsf{LangInstance}}}$ in a visual concrete 
% syntax. We can easily manually check that $\mathsf{Form}\rhd \mathsf{PCADC}$.

\end{newdef}

\begin{olddef}
Technological spaces used for meta-metamodelling, such as grammarware or 
graphs (cf. Def. \ref{def:MMM}), constitute proper formalisms that were 
extensively studied mathematically (cf. 
\cite{B:Rozenberg:1997,B:Aho-etAl:2006}, among others).
\end{olddef}
\begin{newdef}
Technological spaces used for meta-metamodelling, such as grammarware or 
graphs, provide proper formalisms that were 
extensively studied mathematically (cf. 
\cite{B:Rozenberg:1997,B:Aho-etAl:2006}, among others).
\end{newdef}
However, in practice, a metamodeller uses a specific language 
framework that implements such technological spaces and provides facilities for 
manipulating (meta-)models. As a result, when creating a language $\mathsf{L}$,
the concrete concrete $\mathsf{CS}$ and abstract $\mathsf{AS}$ syntaxes are 
expressed as (linguistic) instances of the technological spaces' languages. 
This allows us to define a \emph{canonical semantics} for any language: the set 
of all valid (linguistic) sentences allowed by the metamodel $\mathsf{AS}$. 

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:AbstractFormalism}Abstract Formalism]
   An \emph{abstract formalism} $\mathsf{F^\star} = 
(\mathsf{AS}, \SMapping, \mathsf{SD}) \in\mathbb{F}$ is a formalism without an 
explicit, user-defined semantics, but rather equipped with the canonical 
semantics of the language $\mathsf{AS}\in\mathcal{M}$ is an instance of.
\end{Definition}
Being regular formalisms (according to Def. \ref{def:Formalism}), the 
implementation relationship naturally extends to abstract formalisms, although 
it may be more precisely defined, e.g. using \emph{a posteriori typing} 
\cite{J:deLara-Guerra:2017}.

It is always possible to extract an abstract formalism  
$\mathsf{F^\star}\in\mathbb{F}$ from a language $\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$ by 
getting rid of $\mathsf{CS}_{\mathsf{L}}$ and considering the canonical 
semantics over $\mathsf{AS}_{\mathsf{L}}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Transformations}
\label{sec:Formalisation-Transformation}

Transformations are the primary tool for capturing manipulations of language 
instances as part of a workflow. They may be arbitrarily complex, and come in 
different variations depending on their features \cite{J:Mens-VonGorp:2006} and 
properties and intents \cite{J:Lucio-Amrani-etAl:2014}. What is relevant in 
this work is the transformation's \emph{signature}, i.e. which source / target 
languages the transformation operates on, rather than how it is specified. As 
usual however, we distinguish between the transformation \emph{specification} 
and its actual \emph{execution}(s).

\begin{Definition}[Transformation\label{def:Transformation}]
   A \emph{transformation specification} $\mathsf{T}\in\mathbb{T}$ is a pair
$\mathsf{T} = ((\mathsf{L_s^{i}})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}, 
(\mathsf{L_t^{j}})_{\mathsf{j}\in[1..m]})$ where  
$(\mathsf{L_s^{i}})_{\mathsf{i}\in [1..n]}$ and
$(\mathsf{L_t^{j}})_{\mathsf{j}\in [1..m]}$ are indexed sets of source and
target languages, respectively, and $\mathsf{spec}$ is a well-formed 
transformation definition written in a transformation language.

   A \emph{transformation execution} $\mathsf{TE_{T}}\in\TE$ is a general 
computation performed on (a) language instance(s) that conform(s) to the source 
language(s) of the transformation $\mathsf{T}\in\mathbb{T}$.
\end{Definition}

% Pursuing on our \textsc{Fsa} example, the \textsc{Uml} State Machines language
% \cite{} offers one concrete syntax to the \textsc{Fsa} formalism (by defining 
% how to represent initial, final and ''normal`` states), but also adds several 
% new concepts like hierarchical / orthogonal states, and reactions over 
% transitions (for facilitating design and integration with other \textsc{Uml} 
% languages, among other reasons) that impose to change the \textsc{Fsa} 
% semantics to take them into account.


% This leads to the usual distinction between 
% \emph{linguisting} and \emph{ontological} instantiation \cite{J:Kuhne:2006}: the 
% linguistic instantiation checks that an element $\mathsf{cs}$ is well-formed 
% regarding the concrete syntax $\mathsf{CS}$; while the ontological 
% instantiation checks the validity of $\mathsf{cs}$ regarding the concrete 
% definition of the abstract syntax $\mathsf{AS}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Workflow}
\label{sec:Workflow}

Workflows constitute the essence of a paradigm: they describe precisely how 
formalisms (or more precisely, languages) are related to each other through 
transformations, in order to achieve an expected intent. 
A workflow is composed of two elements: a \emph{Formalism Transformation Graph} 
(\textsc{Ftg}) describes explicitly the links between formalisms / languages, 
stating what possible transformations may be used; and a \emph{Process Model} 
(\textsc{Pm}) describes how language instances are 
combined together to achieve the intent $\iota$. Combining both elements 
results in the \textsc{Ftg+Pm} formalism and language that has already been 
described in 
\cite{Mustafiz-etAl:2012,Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2013,TR:Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2012}.

Before providing a definition of \textsc{Ftg+Pm}, we need to introduce a naming 
mechanism: instead of directly manipulating languages and transformations, a 
repository links the names used by an \textsc{Ftg+Pm} to their actual items. 
This linking is formally captured by the following definition:


\moussa{All FTG+PM I ever seen, either published by the original authors, or 
contributed by the COST participants, rely on \emph{languages}, not 
\emph{formalism} (as per the definitions provided in this paper). In a way, it 
makes sense: since formalisms are ''mathematical`` object, they have no 
concrete existence (although, as always, we often associate to a formalism a 
''visual`` syntax to facilitate understanding: this is what all mathematicians 
do to convey their ideas!) beyond, say LaTeX formulaes and pictures. So IMHO, 
FTG is a misleading name!!! Once the link between language and formalism is 
establish, it ultimately does not change much in the definitions: IMO, it even 
makes them more natural and understable than those falsely relying on 
formalisms. FEEL FREE TO ARGUMENT OTHERWISE!}

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Naming}Naming]
   Two \emph{naming functions} associate (sorted) names to their actual item:
   \begin{displaymath}
      \begin{array}{rcl}
         form  &\colon& \mathsf{AbstractFormalismN} \to \mathbb{F}\\
         trans &\colon& \mathsf{TransformationN} \nrightarrow \mathbb{T}\\
         lang  &\colon& \mathsf{LanguageN} \to \mathbb{L}
      \end{array}
   \end{displaymath}
\end{Definition}

An \textsc{Ftg} can be seen as a collection of transformations that are 
considered useful for a given context. Since transformation names are actually 
used, we use a functional definition.

\andreas{Shouldn't it be $\FTG(AFL,T)$ (in the following?), also I'm not sure
that I understand the notation of the parametrized set $\FTG(AFL,T)$ correctly}
\begin{Definition}{(Extended) Formalism Transformation Graph (x\textsc{Ftg})}
%%
Let $\mathsf{AFL} \eqdef \mathsf{AbstractFormalismN} \cup 
\mathsf{LanguageN}$ be the union of (abstract) formalisms and languages names. A 
\emph{Formalism Transformation Graph} $\mathsf{FTG} \in \FTG(FL, T)$ is a 
function  $\mathsf{FTG} \colon T \to \langle FL \rangle \times \langle FL 
\rangle \times \mathbb{B}$ restricted to specific subsets of language names $FL 
\subseteq \mathsf{AFL}$ and transformation names $T\subseteq 
\mathsf{TransformationN}$, and the boolean value indicates whether the 
transformation is automatic or not (meaning that it becomes a human activity).
%
\end{Definition}

\noindent
For $t \mapsto (\langle fl_1, \ldots, fl_n \rangle, \langle fl'_1, \ldots, 
fl'_m \rangle, b)\in \mathsf{FTG}$, we call the $fl_i$s (resp. $fl'_j$s) the 
\emph{source} (resp. \emph{target}) of $t$ in $\mathsf{FTG}$. 
Compared to the original definition of \textsc{Ftg} 
\cite{Mustafiz-etAl:2012,TR:Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2012}, the source(s) and/or 
target(s) of $t$ may be abstract formalisms instead of only languages: we 
require in this case that $t$ does not map to any transformation specification 
(i.e. $trans(t) = \bot$). This extension confer users the possibility of 
defining ''template`` transformations that rely on the concepts and semantics 
of the abstract formalism, enforcing reuse of transformations at the expense of 
the capacity to actually match template transformations to actual 
transformations, and abstract formalisms to languages. \moussa{Refer to MDE 
research about trafo reuse and model morphisms/typing!}

% In practice, we represent \textsf{FTG} with colored rounds for transformations 
% (names) to distinguish between automatic and manual ones, and shared rectangles 
% for languages (names).

\medskip
As its name indicates, a \textsc{Pm} describes a process, i.e. a set of 
activities that are combined together towards achieving a particular goal. 
Instead of reinventing a Domain-Specific Language for this well-studied domain, 
we simply specialise one standard and well-known language that covers our 
needs, namely \textsc{Uml}'s Activity Diagrams.

\moussa{Currently, we don't use actors, as it is the case in UML AD with 
swimlanes, which provide some context about how actions (in our case, 
transformations) are performed: who, where, etc. I remember we briefly 
mentionned that during the Workshop...} 

\begin{Definition}[\label{def:PM}Process Model (\textsc{Pm})]
% %
A \emph{process model} $\mathsf{P}\in\PM$ is an instance of a \textsc{Uml}
Activity Diagram where
\begin{itemize}
   \item $\mathsf{ActionNode}$s are labelled by transformation instance names 
typed by their conforming transformation specifications, and may be 
\emph{hierarchical} and may contain input/output $\mathsf{Pin}$s; and 
   \item $\mathsf{ObjectNode}$s are labelled by language instance names typed 
by their conforming languages; and 
   \item $\mathsf{ControlNode}$s include 
$\mathsf{Decision}$/$\mathsf{Merge}$, $\mathsf{Fork}$/$\mathsf{Join}$ and 
$\mathsf{Init}$/$\mathsf{Final}$s nodes.   
\end{itemize}
%%
\end{Definition}
\begin{newdef}
Fig.~\ref{fig:Process} illustrates a process for \textsc{PCad} 
\begin{figure}[t]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.98\columnwidth]{process}
   \vspace{-1em}
   \caption{A process model for \textsc{PCad} that yields a closed shape and exports it.}%
   \label{fig:Process}%
\end{figure}
\end{newdef}
%%
We may distinguish in the concrete syntax $\mathsf{ControlFlow}$s from 
$\mathsf{ObjectFlow}$s to emphasize the control and make the process more 
prominent. 
We assume that $\mathsf{ActionNode}$ names and $\mathsf{ObjectNode}$ names 
are distinct and unique. We also require that \textsc{Pm}s are well-formed 
wrt. their \textsc{Ftg}.

Notice that our definition for x\textsc{Ftg}s relies solely on \emph{names}: a 
framework should take care of retrieving the actual transformation item (as per 
Def. \ref{def:Transformation}) from the transformation name (trough 
the $trans$ of Def. \ref{def:Naming}), and should check that the language 
instances used as object nodes conform to languages that actually implement the 
abstract formalisms or languages (through $form$ and $lang$) mapped to that 
transformation name in the appropriate 
order.

\medskip
The following definition simply puts things together: a workflow is composed of 
an \textsc{Ftg} together with several well-typed \textsc{Pm}s. 

\andreas{Shouldn't the following defintion use xFTG?}
\begin{Definition}[\label{def:Workflow}Workflow]
   A \emph{workflow} $\mathsf{W}\in\mathbb{W}(FL, T)$ is a pair $\mathsf{W} = 
(\mathsf{FTG}, \mathsf{P})$ where $\mathsf{FTG}\in\FTG(FL, T)$ and 
$\mathsf{P}\in\wp(\PM)$, such that $\mathsf{P}$ is well-formed (noted 
$\mathsf{P} \blacktriangleright \mathsf{FTG}$) wrt. $\mathsf{FTG}$, i.e. for 
each $\mathsf{ActionNode}$ inside $\mathsf{P}$ with name 
$tn\in\mathsf{TransInstance}$,
\begin{itemize}
   \item $tn$ is explicitly typed by a transformation (name) captured in the 
domain of $\mathsf{FTG}$ (i.e. $type(tn) = t \in \Dom{\mathsf{FTG}}$);

   \item for each source or target $fl_i$ of $t$ at rank $i$, there exists a 
$\mathsf{Pin}$ at rank $i$ connected (as input or output) to an 
$\mathsf{ObjectNode}$ carrying an object (instance) $\mathsf{LI}\in 
\mathsf{LangInstance}$ typed by a language $\mathsf{L}\in\mathbb{L}$, such that 
$\mathsf{LI} \;\rhd\; \mathsf{L}$, and $\mathsf{L}\rightsquigarrow F$, then one 
of the following holds:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item $fl_i\in \mathsf{AbstractFormalismN}$ then $fl_i$ denotes an 
abstract formalism that should refine (some 
of) the formalisms implemented by $\mathsf{L}$, i.e. $form(fl_i) \sqsubseteq 
\mathsf{F'_{k_1}}, \ldots form(fl_i) \sqsubseteq \mathsf{F'_{k_n}}$ such that 
$\mathsf{F'_{k_1}}, \ldots \mathsf{F'_{k_n}} \subseteq F$;
      
      \item $fl_i\in \mathsf{LanguageN}$ then $fl_i$ denotes a language. The 
language that should refine $\mathsf{L}$ i.e. $lang(fl_i) \sqsubseteq 
\mathsf{L}$.
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
\noindent
When clear from context, or unnecessarily detailed, we simply note the set of 
workflows $\mathbb{W}$, without any indication of languages or 
transformations (sets).

Similar to the original  
\cite{Mustafiz-etAl:2012,Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2013,TR:Lucio-Mustafiz-etAl:2012},
our definition does not impose a particular topology on the $\mathsf{PM}$ as 
long as transformations are well-formed. However, the original definition 
simply rely on a name-matching typing: a transformation (resp. language) 
instance in a $\mathsf{PM}$ is denoted using \UML's Object notation for names, 
say $\mathsf{:Trans}$, that need to match an existing transformation (name) 
$\mathsf{Trans}$ in $\mathsf{FTG}$. In constrast, we relaxed this matching 
process by allowing ''template`` transformations based on abstract formalisms 
that capture the main concepts manipulated by a transformation, which imposes 
to rely on the two relations of Def. \ref{def:Implementation} (implementation 
and refinement). Similar to substitution for object-oriented methods, this 
paves the way to more intensive reuse of transformation ''templates'' at the 
expense of checking that the refinement relations hold.

\begin{Example}[\label{ex:TBA}\textsc{Pcad} Workflow]
   Figure \ref{fig:PCAD-FTG} depicts an \textsc{Ftg} for \textsc{Cad} with 7 
transformations that have the abstract formalism $\mathsf{Product}$ as source, 
target or both. For example, an iterative process may instantiate 
$\mathsf{Create}$, $\mathsf{Modify}$ and $\mathsf{isValid}$ to produce a target 
$\mathsf{Product}$ that is guaranteed to be always valid.

\subsection{Paradigm}
\label{sec:PS}

From our viewpoint, a paradigm is a set of properties that captures 
certain specific characteristics that shall hold over languages and/or 
processes. To simplify the checking, we define a \emph{paradigmatic structure} 
as a potential candidate holding a particular paradigm.

\begin{Definition}[Paradigmatic Structure]
   A \emph{paradigmatic structure} $\mathsf{PS}\in \PS$ is a pair $\mathsf{PS} 
= (L, W)$ where $L\in \wp(\mathbb{L})$ is a set of languages and 
$W \in \wp(\mathbb{W})$ is a set of workflows.
\end{Definition}

Table \ref{tab:Properties} already described some interesting properties 
related to three well-known paradigms. As easily noticeable, properties span 
over all elements constituting a paradigmatic structure: the components of the 
languages involved (and potentially, properties that require certain 
combinations of languages); transformations; and also the processes. Some 
paradigms may also have ''sanity-check`` properties that characterise the 
paradigm iself. We will call these properties capturing the essence of a 
paradigm \emph{paradigmatic properties}.

Following the mantra of modelling ''at the most appropriate 
level of abstraction``, it becomes impossible at the abstraction level of this 
presentation to formally (i.e. intensionally) define the nature of such a large 
class of properties. We therefore provide an extensional definition: we note 
$\mathcal{P}(S)$ the set of all possible properties expressible over a 
structure $S$. 


\begin{Definition}[\label{def:ParaProperties}Paradigmatic Properties]
   A \emph{paradigmatic property} is a tuple 
$\pi = (\pi_{\mathsf{L}},\pi_{\mathsf{W}},\pi_{\mathsf{PS}}) \in \Pi$ where
\begin{itemize}
   \item $\pi_{\mathsf{L}} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{L})$ is a set of properties 
over languages;
   \item $\pi_{\mathsf{W}} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{W})$ is a set of properties 
over workflows;
   \item $\pi_{\mathsf{PS}}\in\mathcal{P}(\PS)$ is a set of 
properties spanning over all components of paradigmatic structures).
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
\noindent
Paradigmatic properties may be expressed through \emph{pattern languages}, e.g. 
for ensuring the presence of certain concepts, or through \emph{dedicated 
logics}, e.g. for ensuring semantic properties. We detail later in the examples 
how some properties described in Table \ref{tab:Properties} may be captured 
precisely.
\begin{newdef}
For instance, relevant paradigmatic properties for \CCAD are that conforming 
languages yield the notion of lines over points in $\mathbb{R^2}$ or that 
conforming workflows support creating drawings and 3D prints from these. 
\end{newdef}

\begin{Definition}{\label{def:Paradigm}Intent --- Paradigm}
   We define an \emph{intent} $\iota$ as a \emph{named} paradigmatic property, 
i.e. $\iota \in [\mathsf{IntentN} \to \Pi]$.

   Let $\mathsf{PS} = (L, W)\in\PS$ be a paradigmatic structure and 
$\mathsf{p}$ an intent (name) captured by a predefined $\iota$ (i.e. 
$\mathsf{p}\in \mathsf{Dom}(\iota)$ such that 
$\iota(\mathsf{p}) = (\pi_{\mathsf{L}}(\mathsf{p}), 
                     \pi_{\mathsf{W}}(\mathsf{p}), 
                     \pi_{\mathsf{PS}}(\mathsf{p}))$). 
$\mathsf{PS}$ is said to \emph{embody} $\mathsf{p}$ (alternatively, 
$\mathsf{PS}$ \emph{follows} $\mathsf{p}$) iff 
\begin{itemize}
   \item the properties $\pi_{\mathsf{L}}(\mathsf{p})$ hold on $L$;
   \item the properties $\pi_{\mathsf{W}}(\mathsf{p})$ hold on $W$; and
   \item the properties $ \pi_{\mathsf{PS}}(\mathsf{p}))$ hold on $\mathsf{PS}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{Definition}
