\textsc{mpm} originated in the Modelling and Simulation community. In 1996, the
EU ESPRIT Basic Research Working Group 8467 formulated a series of simulation
policy guidelines \cite{Vangheluwe-VansteenkisteKerckhoffs-1996} identifying the
need for ``a multi-paradigm methodology to express model knowledge using a blend
of different abstract representations rather than inventing some new
super-paradigm''. In \cite{Vangheluwe-Vansteenkiste1996}, an \textsc{mpm} and
Simulation methodology is proposed, with a specific focus on combining multiple
formalisms. Later, \textsc{mpm} became a well-recognised research field with
large body of research produced and published in a series of \textsc{mpm}
workshops at the MoDELS conference (since 2006). Many of the \textsc{mpm} ideas
have been developed, since 2004, at the yearly Computer Automated Multi-Paradigm
Modelling (CAMPaM) workshop at McGill University's Bellairs Research Institute.
The \textsc{cost} Action IC1404 \textsc{mpm4cps} (\url{http://mpm4cps.eu})
surveyed some existing languages and tools, and summarized the languages and
techniques for modelling \textsc{cps} in an ontology.
It is this  preliminary work that triggered the research presented in this
paper.
To the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been a clear attempt to formally
describe the notion of \textsc{mpm}.
