Like for programming paradigms that are used to classify general-purpose programming languages, modelling paradigms can be used to characterise the many modelling approaches making use of formalisms, tools and workflows to develop complex cyber-physical systems. However there is a lack of precise definition of this modelling paradigm notion. Having such precise notion would be very useful to design environments to support modelling in these paradigms. In this paper, we present a formal framework aimed at capturing this notion, in a first step towards a comprehensive formalisation of multi-paradigm modelling. Our formalisation is illustrated for the Computer Aided Design paradigm used in the process of making cookie stencils with a simplified dedicated modelling formalism. 
%This paper will astonish you by presenting a formalisation of a well-known
%concept that remains very vague in the mind of almost all computer scientist
%and/or software engineer (except, obviously, the authors... after one week at a
%workshop swimming and working). Stay tuned for that! \dominique{Write a better
%and accurate abstract :-)}
