The notion of a programming paradigm is used to classify programming languages
and their accompanying workflows based on their salient features. Similarly, the
notion of a \emph{modelling paradigm} can be used to characterise the plethora
of modelling approaches used to engineer complex Cyber-Physical Systems.
Modelling paradigms encompass formalisms, abstractions, workflows and supporting
tools and tool chains.  A precise definition of this modelling paradigm notion
is lacking however. Such a definition will increase insight, will allow for
formal reasoning about the consistency of modelling frameworks and may serve as
the basis for the construction of new design (modelling, simulation,
verification, synthesis, \ldots) environments.
We present a formal framework aimed at capturing the notion of modelling
paradigm, as a first step towards a comprehensive formalisation of
multi-paradigm modelling. Our formalisation is illustrated by CookieCAD, a
simple Computer Aided Design paradigm used in the development of cookie
stencils.
