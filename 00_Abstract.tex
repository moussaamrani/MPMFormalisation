The notion of a programming paradigm is used to classify programming languages and their accompanying workflows based on their salient features. Similarly, the notion of a \emph{modelling paradigm} can be used to characterise the plethora of modelling approaches used to engineer complex Cyber-Physical Systems. Modelling paradigms encompass formalisms, abstractions, workflows and supporting tools and tool chains  A precise definition of this modelling paradigm notion is lacking however. A precise definition will increase insight, will allow for formal reasoning about the consistency of the framework and may serve as the basis for the construction of design (modelling, simulation, verification, synthesis, \ldots) environments. In this paper, we present a formal framework aimed at capturing this notion, as a first step towards a comprehensive formalisation of multi-paradigm modelling. Our formalisation is illustrated by CookieCAD, a simple Computer Aided Design paradigm used in the development of cookie stencils. 
%This paper will astonish you by presenting a formalisation of a well-known
%concept that remains very vague in the mind of almost all computer scientist
%and/or software engineer (except, obviously, the authors... after one week at a
%workshop swimming and working). Stay tuned for that! \dominique{Write a better
%and accurate abstract :-)}
